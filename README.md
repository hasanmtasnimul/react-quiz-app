## Project: React Quiz App

#### This is my first React pet project with deployment which utilized core concepts of React like functional components, props, conditional rendering, useState, useEffect and useRef. The quiz data was fetched using axios from [TriviaAPI](https://the-trivia-api.com/). For styling basic CSS Flexbox was used. Finally, it was deployed on vercel.
