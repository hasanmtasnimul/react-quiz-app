## Project: React Quiz App

#### This is my first React pet project with deployment. I used core concepts of React like functional components, props, conditional rendering, useState, useEffect and useRef. The quiz data was fetched using axios from [TriviaAPI](https://the-trivia-api.com/). For styling basic CSS Flexbox as used. Finally, it was deployed on vercel.
